nickkiboy,"This was the only restaurant we visited twice while staying in San Francisco principally because it offered the best value for money dining we experienced. 

The restaurant was popular with a nice atmosphere set back from some of the more commercial and variable quality restaurants...",50
douglase807,"This is a pleasant neighborhood restaurant offering good but not great food.  I have eaten here many times and enjoyed it.

But the notion that this is the 10th best restaurant in San Francisco is completely absurd and an offense to the truly great restaurants...",30
TravelgalCathy,Had Sunday brunch at SWEET MAPLE in San Francisco and the wait was only 15 minutes and we were happy to be seated outside. They use top-quality locally-sourced organic ingredients in their dishes and it's a popular brunch spot! There are a few other locations...,30
Tori K,"I have always loved Kokkari.
Had dinner at the bar 10/7/23.
We like to dine at the bar for the interactive experience. 
The bar tender was cold, unattentive and borderline rude. For example: when we sat down he was making a drink that was beautiful...",20
Tony R,"This Michelin three star restaurant is excellent and worthy of its three stars.  We had what seemed like a 50 course meal (not really but it seemed that way).  At the end we could not even eat the last course, the squab.  Everything was excellent...",50
Trip28897426522,"We spent a week in San Francisco.  While there we stopped in at Wipeout for a beer and lunch.  We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender.  the establishment was relaxed and comfortable.  The food portions were large, we could have shared something....",50
nathalied920,"Good service, terrible food. There were no prices on the menu for wine. The burger we ordered was cooked dry, flavourless, stale bread, and even the tomato and lettuce didn't taste good. For the Go Wild bowl and rice, the meat was way overcooked and...",10
doofvfood,"Was walking towards Pier 39 from Chinatown when I saw some people entering Mo's & followed in! 

People were friendly & gave a nice welcome. It wasn't too busy when I arrived but it got busier with more arrivals as the morning progressed. 

I ordered...",40
Gpsywmn,"The interior looked great and we would have loved to dine in, however, we did get our food to go. We ordered Crawfish beignets, Catfish des Allemands, and Gumbo which was delicious! We even had dessert, a chocolate beignet & an apple beignet. The food...",50
ams44,Excellent food with prices that were very reasonable! Good service by well trained staff - you need to read the background on this restaurant to appreciate the staff! A short walk (about 1/4 mile from the Giants’ stadium). Nice indoor and outdoor seating (though it...,50
gulietta,"Very nice service and I had a lovely bowl that I can wholeheartedly recommend. 
We had calamari for an appetizer and the chef battered and fried some lemon slices. Deeelish. 
Partner had a mix catch. Good fish - but a bit heavy on the batter...",30
gregsX901HR,"Walked in, no rese on a Fri night.  Seated in bar area immediately.  Decent, if pricey, wine list.  Good service.  First-class swordfish carpaccio (never had it, had to try it), overcooked/""crusty"" porcini-topped lasagna special not great, braised lamb shank special -- outstanding and had to...",40
dmyths,"I had an outstanding experience at the Lighthouse Cafe! The staff was excellent, welcoming, and incredibly helpful. Our waitress was fantastic; she ensured that we never wanted for anything during our meal. I can't wait to visit again!",50
Allison C,Walk in whilst in the area and ended up being one of the best meals I’ve had. Really vibrant atmosphere and friendly staff along with some interesting dishes,50
Mark P,"This is a truly outstanding restaurant featuring Hawaiian food. The cocktails were creative and strong, the food was excellent, and service was first rate too.  I stuck to the vegetarian options and left very happy.",50
Wereldreiziger,"We very much enjoyed our dinner at this cosy restaurant. The food is of great quality; you can tell they use fresh high quality ingredients. Portions are quite big, at least for us Europeans, so we only shared a starter and had a main course....",40
L_Smith256,"We had some time to kill before our sail on the Schooner FredaB, so we stopped in for dessert.  I had been wanting a cannoli.  It was extremely delicious!  My husband had the Tres Leches Cake. He loved it!",50
EndlessVoyage,"We had the Vincent Van Dough and the MOMA pizza both were beautiful to look at, crust was magnificent, plentiful fillings, quality cheese and generous size.  The salads are huge but at $12 made with crispy lettuce and lovely toppings. Perfect!  It is so nice...",50
micheller607,"Loved this place, great options, very clean and friendly. Everything can be done non-dairy so that was a big win for me.",50
flytrap55,"We popped into hear for breakfast as it is very close to our hotel. 

First of all, I'd say the look of it does put you off, but the reviews on here inspired us to try. 

We were seated and given our menus. The menu...",30
Cherdawn,"The seafood linguine was so good! If anything it had too much seafood… if that’s possible. 

My husband had the Classic Cioppino and the seafood was more than abundant! 

If I had a negative it would be that the wine was a bit rough… if...",50
Lurfer1,"Great spot for breakfast / lunch with really helpful staff and good food.
Would definitely eat here again",50
Q9233XM,"It is unexpected to find this restaurant ranked high amongst SF restaurants. It has very, very little to recommend it. The food is unacceptable (I actually threw up my food an hour later) - the three of us all got inedible food. The restaurant is...",20
Rameshlcfc,"The place looks great and very appealing inside. That's all that is good about it!
The food served left us very disappointed with hefty bill.
Everything overpriced here including drinks (which we decided not to have).
The food served was lukewarm. 
The plates were hot...",20
doobla228,Probably one more of the best Italian meals. The service and food was amazing. The frutti di mare and the gnocchi were both outstanding.,50
hisharel,Reservations not honored at all. We made a reservation on open table and were perfectly on time with a party of 3. There were no empty tables. 20 minutes later several other small parties walked in with reservations and none were honored. Hostess completely overwhelmed,10
Adventure35426186013,Amazing food and staff. Fresh ingredients and home cooked feel. We stayed in hotel Zephyr and this place was just a few mins walk away.,50
Roy M,"Nice location but the food selection and quality is poor. I wanted to try the Manhattan chowder and asked if they could add shrimp. No. ""Its pre made and we don't make additions."" So I had the crab salad and added shrimp. It was ok...",30
Samantha K,The best Brazilian steak house. So many good sides as well as delicious meats. Our servers were amazing. We loved Milton Gaucho. Dont pass up the cheese and honey.,50
Wendell W,"I've been hanging around The Castro in San Francisco off and on since 1982 (and lived there from 1985-1994) so I was absolutely sure I knew all there was to know, even with the changes that naturally occur over the years.  Last week I reconnected...",50
Rich F,"The food is always great! I always start with the chowder and the rest of the menu is just delicious,all pleasingly so. Great location, usually enjoy an afternoon, and walk the island perimeter, then back to Mersea for another sipping of something hot or cold...",50
Frances H,It was a fantastic experience and the ladies were awesome and personable.  This is my second time coming and I have enjoyed it each time.,50
Jessica E,"The table was ready right when we arrived on a busy Saturday night. It was booked through Open Table at 8:45. My partner and I had the garlic & parmasian focaccia OMG a must have! & warm olives (very salty) to start, followed by the...",50
donnaks,So we went here for the outstanding reviews and thought it was fine BUT….found a big issue. The 2 waitstaff were friendly and hard working and juggled takeout orders along with all the tables…it was a little chaotic but they managed but would have benefitted...,30
Navigate56655804359,"We were visiting from the UK. Dined here on the reviews from Trip Advisor. Absolutely didn’t disappoint. The pasta was so fresh and my husband stated that his bruschetta was the very best he’d ever tasted. Excellent service, from this lovely restaurant. Highly recommend.",50
Sangeeta P,"Totally disappointed with the food. The server kinda forced us to take the combi crab, prawns and mussels platter and a fried rice. It was totally not worth taste and price wise.",30
laboswell,We arrived at an opportune time as the restaurant filled quickly. The four of us all ordered something different and we all loved our dish. A bottle of Chianti and it made for a great dinner. Quick  and friendly service. Highly recommend.,50
